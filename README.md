This is a ML project deployed on AWS cloud.

**Project: Automatic Email Management System**

Developed an Automatic Email Management System featuring a novel spam classifier that accurately distinguishes between valid and invalid messages. Deployed the machine learning model using Streamlit and launched the integrated Streamlit application and model on an AWS EC2 instance. This involved configuring roles, security settings, and optimizing the deployment environment, demonstrating my ability to weave machine learning with DevOps practices. This project underscores my proficiency in model deployment, cloud computing, and creating practical, real-world ML applications.
This file contains the email dataset that i used for the training of my ML model along with the model+streamlit code. I am attaching few screenshots that i took when i deployed this model on AWS.

1)Creating EC2 instance for hosting the model.Named the instance as streamlit_servr
